        Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now . On her desk, laying between the copies of <i>
            Nature,New Scientist,


        </i>
        and all the other scientific joumals her work had appeared in,was a well thumbed copy of <em>
            On The Road. lt had been Molly's favourite book scien college, and the longer she spent in these four walls
            the more she felt she needed to be free <br>
        </em>

        <p>
            She had spent the last ten years in this room sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
            that <q>
                Work in the refuge of people who have nothing better to do
            </q>.Although many considered her pioneeing work, unrevaling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an
            outstanding achievement, Molly<i>
                did
            </i>think she had something better to do
